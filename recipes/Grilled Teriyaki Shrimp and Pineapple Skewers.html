    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h3>
    <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer weeknights or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.</p>
    
    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>     
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>    
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>    
        <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>    
        <li>½ fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>    
        <li>skewers</li>    
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh cilantro (Optional)</li>    
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds (Optional)</li>    
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
        <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>         
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Cook's Notes</strong></h2>
    <p>Try to cut the pineapple chunks approximately the same size as the shrimp for even grilling.</p>
    <p>If using wooden skewers, soak in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.</p>
